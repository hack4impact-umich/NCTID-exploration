0,NCT00001208,Botulinum Toxin for the Treatment of Involuntary Movement Disorders,Movement Disorders,National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),"Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by bacteria. This bacteria produces several toxins one of which is botulinum toxin A. This toxin causes the symptoms of food poisoning. Small amounts of botulinum toxin A have been used to treat speech disorders such as stuttering and problems with the muscles of the eyes.

The study examines the effectiveness of botulinum toxin as treatment for a variety of movement disorders. The goals of the study are to refine the technique of treatment to provide the best results, to improve the understanding of how botulinum toxin works on movement disorders, and find other conditions that may be treatable with botulinum toxin.

In addition, researchers also plan to study the possible use of botulinum toxin F alone and in combination with botulinum toxin A in patients who do not respond to botulinum A toxin treatment.<TAB>",Bethesda,prpl@cc.nih.gov,For more information at the NIH Clinical Center contact Office of Patient Recruitment (OPR),800-411-1222,TTY8664111010,Contact,United States,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike",Maryland,Recruiting,20892
